## How to Play

- You start with **25 charisma points**.  
  Each move costs **1 charisma**. When charisma runs out, the game ends.  

- You begin with **6 arrows**.  
  Use them wisely to slay dragons or you may end up defenseless.  

- On each turn you choose an action:
  - `N` – move North  
  - `S` – move South  
  - `E` – move East  
  - `W` – move West  
  - `F` – Fight: shoot an arrow in a direction  
  - `Q` – Quit game  

- On the cave map, which you occasionally glimpse, the following legend is used:
  - `H` – Hero (you)  
  - `$` – Treasure (worth 100–199 gold)  
  - `D` – Dragon (deadly unless killed with arrows)  
  - `M` – Magic cave (teleports you)  
  - `Q` – Quicksand (from which there is no escape)  

An **amulet** warns you if something dangerous is near.  

Your goal:  
Survive as long as possible, slay dragons, and collect gold before running out of charisma.
